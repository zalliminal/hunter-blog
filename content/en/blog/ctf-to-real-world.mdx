## Challenges vs real systems

CTF challenges are designed to be solved. Production systems are designed to **survive**.

The trick is to reuse the mindset, not the exact payloads.

```javascript
const payload = `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`;
```

Instead of hunting for the one magical gadget, map out:

1. Where user-controlled data lands
2. How it is stored, transformed, rendered
3. What protections are actually enforced
