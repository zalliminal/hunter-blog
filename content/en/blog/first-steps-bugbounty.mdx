## Start from the surface

Before touching any fancy tooling, understand the target like a human.

- Read the docs
- Click through the app like a normal user
- Note every place that accepts input

```bash
httpx -l scope.txt -silent | tee alive.txt
```

This is not magic, just a very boring, very repeatable process.

## Keep a sharp log

Use whatever note system you like, but keep it **consistent**:

- What you tried
- What you saw
- Why you think it behaved that way
